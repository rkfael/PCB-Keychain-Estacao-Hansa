<h1 align="center"> Estação Hansa PCB Keychain </h1>

<h2 align="center"> Short Articles Series </h2>

A creative idea to gift friends and subscribers to my YouTube channel called 'Estação Hansa' where I post videos about train rides and share a little bit of tourism in Brazil, especially the city where I live. 

I made this PCB Keychain using the *EasyEDA* software and then ordered it online at [*JLCPCB*](https://jlcpcb.com/IYB)

You can order the fabrication according to your preferences of color, thickness, PCB material and more.
